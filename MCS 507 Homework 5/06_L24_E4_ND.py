HW 5, #6

Solving yâ€² = s(t)w where s(t) is the speed and w the normalized
direction vector of a predator chasing a prey gives in y the
coordinates of the predator. Set up a model for a prey to move in a
straight line and let s(t) be a large enough constant so the prey
gets caught. Plot the trajectories of prey and predator.
